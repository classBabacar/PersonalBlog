# Technologies
- Node + Express
- Angular + Typescript
- MongoDB
- MLabs (Possibly)

# Running Application
 - In the future I plan to have this always up but for now it's as follows:
1. cd into the backend directory `cd backend`
2. Type: `npm install`
2. Type: `npm run dev`

A little side project I'm making before work!
